# Changelog

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Refactored codebase to use pixi as our development environment and make this package pip installable.

## [1.2.1]

-   Fixed a bug in generating multiple non-aromatic ring conformations. This
  functionality worked correctly when Gypsum-DL was originally published (e.g.,
  with rdkit 2020.03.1). But due to changes made to more recent versions of
  rdkit, Gypsum-DL produced only one ring conformation, even if multiple were
  reasonably possible. It now produces multiple ring conformations even on
  recent versions of rdkit (e.g., `2023.03.1`). We recommend using the lastest
  version of rdkit.
-   Gypsum-DL now uses `AllChem.ETKDGv3` if it's available.
-   Modernized codebase some. Python2 no longer officially supported.
-   Updated copyright year to 2023.

## [1.2.0]

-   Added to the Durrant-lab filters to compensate for an amide-related bug in
  MolVS, one of Gypsum-DL's dependencies. MolVS sometimes tautomerizes
  `NC(=O)C[*]` to `N\C(O)=C\[*]`, so the Durrant-lab filters now remove any
  tautomers with substructures that match the SMARTS string
  `[$(N)]C(=C)[$([OH]),$([O-])]`.
-   Previously, the Durrant-lab filters only removed terminal iminols, which are
  improbable tautomers of terminal amides. According to
  [DataWarrior](https://openmolecules.org/datawarrior/), internal iminols (e.g.,
  `C\N=C(\C)O`) are also improbable, so these are now removed as well.

## [1.1.9]

-   Improved error handling when loading SDF files that are poorly formatted
  (e.g., that do not specify charged nitrogen atoms). Gypsum-DL depends on
  RDKit for SDF loading, and RDKit apparently cannot handle these errors. If
  you find that Gypsum-DL skips many of your compounds with a `Warning: Could
  not convert some SDF-formatted files to SMILES...` error, consider using an
  SMI (SMILES) file instead.

## [1.1.8]

Updated `README.md` to help some users who were having trouble installing
RDKit.

## [1.1.7]

-   Updated the `README.md` file, specifically the `Important Caveats` section.
-   Modest speed improvements when enumerating compounds with many chiral
  centers. (No need to enumerate far more compounds than will ultimately be
  used, given the values of the `thoroughness` and `max_variants_per_compound`
  user parameters.) This update should also allow Gypsum-DL to more
  efficiently use available memory.
-   Similar speed and memory improvements when enumerating compounds with many
  double bonds that have unspecified stereochemistries.

## [1.1.6]

-   Corrected minor bug that caused Durrant-lab filters to inappropriately
  retain some compounds when running in multiprocessing mode.
-   Fixed testing scripts, now that Durrant-lab filters remove iminols.

## [1.1.5]

-   Updated Dimorphite-DL to 1.2.4. Now better handles compounds with
  polyphosphate chains (e.g., ATP).
-   Minor updates to the Durrant-lab filters:
-   When running Gypsum-DL without the `--use_durrant_lab_filters` parameter,
    Gypsum-DL now displays a warning. We strongly recommend using these
    filters, but we choose not to turn them on by default in order to maintain
    backwards compatibility.
-   Added filter to compensate for a phosphate-related bug in MolVS, one of
    Gypsum-DL's dependencies. MolVS sometimes tautomerizes `[O]P(O)([O])=O` to
    `[O][PH](=O)([O])=O`, so the Durrant-lab filters now remove any tautomers
    with substructures that match the SMARTS string `O=[PH](=O)([#8])([#8])`.
-   Added filters to compensate for frequently seen, unusual MolVS
    tautomerization of adenine. The Durrant-lab filters now remove tautomers
    with substructures that match `[#7]=C1[#7]=C[#7]C=C1` and
    `N=c1cc[#7]c[#7]1`.
-   Added filter to remove terminal iminols. While amide-iminol
    tautomerization is valid, amides are far more common, and accounting for
    this tautomerization produces many improbable iminol compounds. The
    Durrant-lab filters now remove compounds with substructures that match
    `[$([NX2H1]),$([NX3H2])]=C[$([OH]),$([O-])]`.
-   Added filter to remove molecules containing `[Bi]`.
-   Gypsum-DL now outputs molecules with total charges between -4e and +4e.
  Before, the cutoff was -2e to 2e. We expanded the range to permit ATP and
  other similar molecules.

## [1.1.4]

-   Updated Dimorphite-DL to 1.2.3.
-   Added `sys.stdout.flush()` commands to ParallelMPI.run (see
  `gypsum_dl/gypsum_dl/Parallelizer.py`) to ensure that print statements
  properly output in large MPI runs.

## [1.1.3]

-   Gypsum-DL used to crash when provided with certain mal-formed SMILES
  strings. It now just skips those SMILES and warns the user that they are
  poorly formed. See Start.py:303 and MyMol.py:747.
-   Durrant-lab filters now remove molecules containing metal and boron atoms.
-   Some Durrant-lab filters are now applied immediately after desalting. We
  discovered that certain substructures cause Gypsum-DL to delay during the
  add-hydrogens step, specifically when Gypsum-DL generates the 3D structures
  required to rank conformers. Removing these compounds before adding
  hydrogens avoids the problem.
-   Improved code formatting.
-   Made minor spelling corrections to the output.

## [1.1.2]

-   Bug fix: thoroughness parameter is now correctly recognized as an int when
  specified from the command line.

## [1.1.1]

-   Updated Dimorphite-DL to version 1.2.2.
-   Corrected spelling in user-parameter names. Parameters that previously used
  "ennumerate" now use "enumerate".
-   Updated MolVS-generated tautomer filters. Previous versions of Gypsum-DL
  rejected tautomers that changed the number of _specified_ chiral centers. By
  default, Gypsum now rejects tautomers that change the total number of chiral
  centers, _both specified and unspecified_. To override the new default
  behavior (i.e., to allow tautomers that change the total number of chiral
  centers), use `--let_tautomers_change_chirality`. See `README.md` for
  important information about how Gypsum-DL treats tautomers.
-   Added Durrant-lab filters. In looking over many Gypsum-DL-generated
  variants, we have identified several substructures that, though technically
  possible, strike us as improbable. See `README.md` for examples. To discard
  molecular variants with these substructures, use the
  `--use_durrant_lab_filters` flag.
-   Rather than RDKit's PDB flavor=4, now using flavor=32.
-   PDB files now contain 2 REMARK lines describing the input SMILES string and
  the final SMILES of the ligand.
-   Added comment to `README.md` re. the need to first use drug-like filters to
  remove large molecules before Gypsum-DL processing.
-   Added comment to `README.md` re. advanced approaches for eliminating
  problematic compounds.

## [1.1.0]

-   Updated Dimorphite-DL dependency from version 1.0.0 to version 1.2.0. See
  `$PATH/gypsum_dl/gypsum_dl/Steps/SMILES/dimorphite_dl/CHANGES.md` for more
  information.
-   Updated MolVS dependency from version v0.1.0 to v0.1.1 2019 release. See
  `$PATH/gypsum_dl/gypsum_dl/molvs/CHANGELOG.md` for more information.
-   Gypsum-DL now requires mpi4py version 2.1.0 or higher. Older mpi4py versions
  can [result in deadlock if a `raise Exception` is triggered while
  multiprocessing](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/mpi4py.run.html).
  Newer mpi4py versions (2.1.0 and higher) provide an alternative command line
  execution mechanism (the `-m` flag) that implements the runpy Python module.
  Gypsum-DL also requires `-m mpi4py` to run in mpi mode (e.g., `mpirun -n
  $NTASKS python -m mpi4py run_gypsum_dl.py ...-settings...`). If you experience
  deadlock, [please contact](mailto:durrantj@pitt.edu) us immediately.

  To test your version of mpi4py, open a python window and run the following
  commands:

    ```python
    >>> import mpi4py
    >>> print(mpi4py.__version__)
    3.0.1
    >>>
    ```

-   Updated the examples and documentation (`-h`) to reflect the above changes.
-   Added a Gypsum-DL citation to the print statement.
